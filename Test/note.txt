Pointers:
Pointers(pointer variables) are special variables that are used to store addresses rather than values.

Pointer Syntax:
int *p;
int* p;

p has been declared as pointer type of int(integer).

Some ways of declaring pointers:
int *p1;
int * p2

Examples of Declaring Pointers:
int* p1, p2;

Assigning Addresses to Pointers:
int *p, s;
s = 10;
p = &s;

Here we can see above that 5 is assigned to s variable and the address of s is assigned to the p pointer;
